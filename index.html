        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <img src="assets/images/Intro-image.jpeg" alt="" />
        <p>
          Let me introduce myself. My name is Anowai Chukwuemeka Stephen, and I
          am proudly Nigerian, of Igbo descent, hailing specifically from
          Anambra State in the southeastern part of Nigeria. Although my roots
          are firmly planted in Anambra, I have spent my entire life in Lagos
          State, one of the most dynamic and vibrant regions of the country.
          Lagos, often regarded as Nigeria’s commercial and industrial hub, is a
          city renowned for its bustling activities, cultural diversity, and
          unrelenting energy. I am a graduate of Geology from Chukwuemeka
          Odumegwu Ojukwu University, Uli, Ihiala, Anambra state Campus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though, a graduate of Geology, I aspire to be a frontend engineer, and
          I aim to go beyond that in the future. Learning frontend engineering
          is just a stepping stone to the greater accomplishments I desire. If I
          ask myself this question - Why am I so passionate about learning a
          tech skill?, I will say that, tech is something that can create impact
          and make live easier for every individual. No one can come out today
          and say that there is no way that these digital products which is a
          result of the present tech industry have not made their lives and
          activities much more easier. Let's talk about how our banks have come
          closer to us through banking websites and apps, how we can create
          schedules and keep track of our To-dos much easily, different ways
          which tech can affect us positively and I want to be a part of that.
          Learning a tech skill gives me the opportunity to count myself in as
          one of those who creates an impact in the fast growing tech industry.

        <h2>Why did I choose Altschool Africa:</h2>
        <p>
          Before I came to know about Altschool Africa, I paid for a web
          development course on Udemy. While it was a good experience, I found
          myself feeling unsatisfied with what I got from it. Platforms like
          Udemy, and other similar online learning platforms, are undeniably
          valuable resources for learning web development. However, they often
          lack one crucial component: community. Learning from these platforms
          can feel isolating at times. Without a sense of community, it’s easy
          to lose motivation, especially when faced with challenges or when the
          learning becomes monotonous. Additionally, I noticed that these
          platforms tend to lack the kind of challenges that push students to
          truly engage with the material and apply what they’ve learned. The
          hands-on, immersive experience that AltSchool Africa promises is often
          missing in many online courses. This is why I chose to enroll in
          AltSchool Africa. It offers a unique, hands-on learning experience
          tailored to the track one chooses to pursue. This practical approach
          ensures that students are constantly engaged, working on real-world
          problems, and gaining experience that goes beyond theory. The
          structured and intense learning environment keeps students on their
          toes, reinforcing the seriousness of the program and the commitment it
          requires. This environment also fosters a culture of independent
          learning, as students are often driven to conduct additional research
          to excel. Another key reason for my decision is the community of
          learners at AltSchool Africa. Collaborating and working alongside
          others who share the same goals and challenges creates a support
          system that makes the learning journey more enriching and less
          isolating. This sense of camaraderie is invaluable and something I
          deeply missed while learning independently on platforms like Udemy. In
          conclusion, my choice to join AltSchool Africa was motivated by its
          emphasis on practical, hands-on learning and the vibrant community it
          offers. These elements, combined, make for a more fulfilling and
          effective learning experience that will undoubtedly enhance my skills
          and prepare me for real-world challenges in web development.

        <p>
          From the reason I gave for choosing AltSchool Africa, it is clear that
          I hold this opportunity in high regard and would not want to let it go
          to waste. AltSchool Africa offers a unique and practical learning
          experience that aligns perfectly with my aspirations in frontend
          engineering. The hands-on approach provided by this platform is a
          golden chance for me to not only deepen my understanding of core
          concepts but also to gain real-world exposure that will shape me into
          a proficient frontend engineer. I intend to maximize this opportunity
          by actively engaging in all the provided resources, assignments, and
          projects. This will not only help me consolidate my existing knowledge
          but also empower me to develop new skills that are highly relevant in
          the tech industry today. Here are the key goals I aim to achieve
          through this program:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Master Core Frontend Technologies: I will ensure that I have a
            strong grasp of essential frontend tools and technologies, such as
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern libraries like React.
          </li>
          <li>
            Develop Real-World Projects: By working on practical projects, I
            will apply theoretical knowledge in real-life scenarios, which will
            help me better understand the intricacies of frontend engineering.
          </li>
          <li>
            Collaborate and Network: I will actively participate in group
            activities and collaborations, which will help me build
            relationships with peers and mentors. These connections will be
            invaluable in my journey as a developer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stay Committed to Continuous Learning: Frontend development is an
            ever-evolving field. I will stay updated with the latest trends and
            best practices to remain competitive and relevant.
          </li>
          <li>
            Build a Portfolio: By the end of the program, I aim to have a
            portfolio of projects that demonstrate my skills, creativity, and
            ability to solve real-world problems.
          </li>
          <li>
            Build a Career Network: I will actively seek out opportunities to
            network with professionals in the tech industry, which will help me
            build a strong professional network and gain valuable insights.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          With this, I am determined to make the most of this opportunity. By
          remaining focused, disciplined, and proactive, I will ensure that the
          knowledge and experience gained from AltSchool Africa propel me toward
          my dream of becoming a skilled and accomplished frontend engineer.
